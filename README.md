# Iono Uno / Iono MKR / Iono RP - Arduino IDE libraries and examples

This repository contains Arduino libraries to be used with [Iono Uno](https://www.sferalabs.cc/product/iono-uno/), [Iono MKR](https://www.sferalabs.cc/product/iono-mkr/) and [Iono RP](https://www.sferalabs.cc/product/iono-rp/).  

Iono is a general-purpose, professional input/output module (a.k.a. PLC) based on a standard [Arduino](http://www.arduino.cc/) or [Raspberry Pi RP2040](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/rp2040/) microcontroller.  

Iono allows you to use your Arduino programming skills, and the vast amount of software available for it, not only for prototypes, but for professional, industrial applications where extreme reliability, ruggedness and compliance with directives for EMC, Electrical Safety and RoHS are required.

Refer to the [Wiki](../../wiki) for usage details, examples and ready-to-use applications.
