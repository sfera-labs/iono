# Iono - Arduino libraries

This repository contains Arduino libraries to be used with [Iono Uno](https://www.sferalabs.cc/product/iono-uno/) and [Iono MKR](https://www.sferalabs.cc/product/iono-mkr/).  

Iono is a general-purpose, professional input/output module (a.k.a. PLC) based on a standard [Arduino](http://www.arduino.cc/) microcontroller.  
Iono allows you to use your Arduino programming skills, and the vast amount of software available for it, not only for prototypes, but for professional applications where extreme reliability, ruggedness and compliance with CE directives for EMC, Electrical Safety and RoHS are required.
